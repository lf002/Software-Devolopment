# Print Statement - This is used to output to the Terminal AKA Console.
print('Mr. Sekol is the coolest teacher in the galaxy. Ask Mr. Wright.')

#Variables - These can change value based on user input or you can just assign a value to them. 
player_name = "Steve"
print(player_name)
#Concatenation = Combine String + Variables to form an output.
print(f"Welcome, {player_name}, it's great to have you here.")
#Pass through the variable into the output
player_name = "Bob"
print(f"Welcome, {player_name}, it's great to have you here.")


#User input - create a variable and ask user for input.
country_of_origin = input(f"Well {player_name}, can you tell me the country you're from? ")
print(f"{player_name} is from {country_of_origin}. ")
